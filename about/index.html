          <h3>I have devoted the last 17 years to computers. They have influenced the world in so many ways. I wonder if we as a
            civilization could manage without them. Technology has changed so much since I first understood there was such a things as a micro-processor. Keeping up with the times is
            a full time job, not to mention trying to gain any ground in this field.</h3>
            
          <h3>For 3 years I served in the US Army, in an Air Defense unit. I gained an unmeasurable amount of information and skill, in a great many subjects. After the Army I worked with             Northrop Grumman, a company whom deals a lot with government contracts. After 4 years I was feed up with the corporate world, with the not knowing if the contract would renew thereby leaving me jobless. As a father to two wonderful children this was not an option. It was then I decided to use my skills not for "the man", but for anyone who might be in need. I have listed here and there my qualifications for this field but you need not rely on words, simply reach out to me by call or text and find out for yourself.</h3>

          <h3>I have no set rate for services. I believe each job requires unique techniques and time, therefore one must also require a unique bill. A bill which we will work out. I do not adhere to any
            corporate standard rate. I perform services ranging from consultation to complete business network overhaul. I have yet to come across something that could not be done. Where there is a will there is a way.</h3>
          <h3>My two children are at the forefront of why I work so hard, although that in itself can take away from the very thing I am trying to do, provide them with the best life
            has to offer. So I work non-stop, sometimes maybe too much. Many a battles I have lost, good will prevail and the war…. well that just getting started!</h3>

		<h3>Research and Development or RND is my forte. I've blown through so many different projects it's unreal.</h3>

          <h2>Why start your own company?</h2>
          <h3>Good question, I started this company due to outrageous prices and illiterate people. I am here to provide a service not to
            take your money and run. This is my life, passion, hobby... In order to have a good business you must do good business. If you were wondering the "1&amp;0" is a play on
            words because computers operate via a Binary Number system that requires a simple yet complex set of 1's and 0's. Although you cannot see them, they are there.</h3>
          <br>
          <h2>I'll tell you a story... once upon a time,</h2>
          <h3>There are some "Computer Repair" shops that I or a customer have taken items to in the past and you would be surprised at the
            hidden fees. For example, if you were to say take a computer that wouldn't turn on to some company you could be charged a fee for "them" to examine it; if they couldn't
            diagnose it there might be a second fee to ship it to a 3rd party, the 3rd party might tax a third fee, MAYBE fix it, and finally a possible fourth fee to ship it back. When it
            arrives back to you in a week or two the attendant might tell you "Sorry there was nothing we could do." Now it is still broken and you are out $$$! That
            is outrageous and one of the main reasons I started this company.</h3>
